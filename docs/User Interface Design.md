# User Interface Design

We will use Grafana because it means I don't have to custom build any visualisations.

Visualizations
- Consistency Tracker 
    - Can use [status history](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/visualizations/panels-visualizations/visualizations/status-history/).
    - [Heatmap](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/visualizations/panels-visualizations/visualizations/heatmap/) to track length of workouts too, not just days I have worked out. This would be better since there are some days I workout multiple times. Can have multiple ones for different exercise types.
- 1RM progression
    - Can use [trend](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/visualizations/panels-visualizations/visualizations/trend/) or [candlestick](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/visualizations/panels-visualizations/visualizations/candlestick/)
- weight?
    - Can use [candlestick](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/visualizations/panels-visualizations/visualizations/candlestick/).
