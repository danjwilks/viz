### Embedding a grafana Panel Requirements
- Doesn't require user to login to grafana
- Doesn't allow user to change any data
- Doesn't allow user to do anything that is permanent from usage to usage

### Solution

- Click panel share, embed and use this iframe.
- For example, open [embed_example.html](embed_example.html) in a browser.
